I saw [ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/) mentioned on Twitter yesterday so
I took a quick look. I read every word on the site and watched the video. I still have no idea
exactly what ethereum is. 

I also downloaded the C++ source code, which includes a file called
*CodingStandards.txt*. It's a laugh riot. Check out these excerpts:

```
a. Use tabs for indentation!
```

This made my cow-orker do a spit take.

```
- Don't worry about having lines of code > 80-char wide.
```

Yeah don't worry about it.

```
c. Don't use braces for condition-body one-liners.
```
